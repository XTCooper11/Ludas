## About
This engine is a hobby project built to be a feature-rich fully Python-based game engine. Unlike the current community leader, Pygame which lacks built in UI. This engine includes everything from rendering, audio, and camera management to both engine and in game UI, scripting, and more.

The name comes from a *Latin* phrase meaning "you play", because at the heart of every game is the player.

## Features

### Graphics
#### 2D:
Ludas uses PyGlet to connect to OpenGL for graphics rendering.
#### (WIP) 3D:
Ludas uses modernGL on top of PyGlet for 3D rendering.
---
### Audio
#### 2D:
Ludas uses the built in PyGlet audio system.
#### (WIP) 3D:
Ludas uses OpenAL for 3D Audio.
---
### Physics
#### 2D:
Ludas uses PyBox2D for physics:
-Rigid Body Dynamics & Collision Detection
-Joints and Constraints (various types)
-Sensors & Triggers
-Continuous Collision Detection (CCD)
-Physics Material Properties (friction, restitution, density)
#### (WIP) 3D:
-Rigid Body Dynamics & Collision Detection
-Soft Body Simulation & Constraints
-Vehicles and Character Controllers
-Collision Filtering & Continuous Collision Detection (CCD)
-Physics Material Properties (friction, restitution, mass)
