## About

Ludas is a plug-and-play **3D game development library** written in pure Python. It focuses solely on 3D, making tasks like rendering, camera movement, and mesh handling easy to implement without needing a full game engine. Built on top of `ModernGL`, `Pyglet`, and `NumPy`, Ludas gives you direct access to the 3D pipeline with simple and clean Python syntax.

The name comes from a *Latin* word meaning "you play" â€” because all games begin with the player.

## Features

### Graphics (3D Only)

Ludas is fully focused on 3D. There is no 2D API. Everything is built around 3D rendering using OpenGL:

* âœ… Easy window creation
* âœ… GLSL shader support
* âœ… 3D mesh loading (.obj)
* âœ… Perspective camera system
* ðŸš§ Lighting (basic and advanced)
* ðŸš§ Scene management (planned)

### Audio

* âœ… Basic audio via `Pyglet` for background music and sound effects
* ðŸš§ 3D positional audio support (planned)

### Physics

* ðŸš§ Planned support for 3D physics using `PyBullet`, including:

  * Rigid body simulation
  * Basic collision detection

### Scripting

* âœ… Write your games entirely in Python
* âœ… No external editor required â€” bring your own IDE

## Roadmap

* [ ] Scene manager and entity system
* [ ] Lighting + shadows
* [ ] Animation system
* [ ] GUI overlay (optional)
* [ ] PyPI package
* [ ] Visual editor (long-term goal)
